# APR Mortgage Calculator

This program calculates APR rates using Newton-Ralphson method to deal with rounding errors that result in payments being a penny off and product a large cumulative amount of capitol. I think that the requirements of this project were a little non-standard for how mortgage interest is typically paid, in practice. But, those were the requirements! 

The user enters three of the four variables listed and the four variable is calculated when the button is clicked. The client did not allow the variables to be spelled out as explicitly as I would have liked. But, this screen shot shows the application.
